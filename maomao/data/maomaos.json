This newer breed is similar to and descended predominantly from Maine Coons and Angora types such as Siberians and Turkish Angoras with Ragdoll type cats mixed in the gene pool. People often ask if my Color Points are Ragdolls, but their facial features are actually more like Maine Coons. They come in traditional Maine Coon colors as well as Ragdoll colors. If you would like to read more on our website, please let me know and I will send you links. We have not updated kitten photos in several years, but you can see photos of grandparents and some of the parents at this site.\r\nThese cats will have long hair like Maine Coons and Ragdolls and their personalities have all the same great qualities. In addition, they will come when called and are extra affectionate. Males may have larger faces and bulkier bodies than Maine Coons. These cats are extremely smart and have wonderful personalities. Males and many of the females are wonderful lap cats.\n\nPlease note that I am unable to text photos or send them from this site.

A $200 non-refundable deposit is required to reserve one of the babies.\n\nThe kittens will be available to go home at 12 weeks at the earliest and will be vaccinated while they are with me but they will require their final vaccinations once in your home. The kittens are sold as limited registration through TICA (spay/neuter contract requires proof of kitten's alter prior to receipt of registration paperwork), any buyer interested in full registration (with breeding rights) should mention this in our initial conversation. There will be an additional fee for full registration.\n\nThe kittens will receive a bill of good health from my veterinarian prior to heading to their new homes and a vet visit is required within 72 hours of when you pick-up your kitten (proof of the visit is required). We do provide a health warranty for full refund within 72 hours if your vet deems the kitten unsuitable for sale (with documentation required from your vet and potentially a second opinion from mine). Our health guarantee supports our belief that we are producing healthy off-spring and that we want to know if any of our kittens show signs of genetically related issues. Thus, if your kitten or cat is diagnosed with a serious genetic defect or congenital disease before 2 years of age we will provide a replacement kitten and work with you to determine the best option for the sick kitten or cat. The types of conditions that would be included as a genetic defect of congenital disease would be life-threatening heart conditions and degenerative nerve disorders (in other words, conditions that effect longevity or quality of life; allergies and innocent heart murmurs do not fall into this category).\n\nPhotos are of some of the available kittens!\n\nGenotype Cats\nwww.facebook.com/genotypecats\n\nwww.genotypecats.com\n\nwww.tranquillhedgies.com\nwww.paradigmpups.com", "main_img_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/2cVr7Y8Sku.jpg", "detail_url": "http://www.hoobly.com/RAOhL/ragdoll-kittens-in-tuscaloosa-al-www-facebook-com-genotypecats.htm", "img_urls": ["http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/2cVr7Y8Sku.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/42gWkpYE55.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/5OMTC6hLwH.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/FIlbMrzMOv.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/N83aPSJNYB.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/O4gfcR1bRo.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/RxcDAszrRS.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/gpBMXB08Pj.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/uE5fHXWoNp.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/wj0iroMDMQ.jpg"]}, {"id": "HLYvY", "title": "Purebred Ragdoll Male", "desc": "Purebred Ragdoll male.

A $200 non-refundable deposit is required to reserve one of the babies. Photos and videos of the kittens appear on our facebook page: www.facebook.com/genotypecats/\n\nThe kittens will be available to go home at 12 weeks and will be vaccinated while they are with me but they will require their final vaccinations once in your home. The kittens are sold as limited registration through TICA (paperwork will be supplied to the buyer upon proof of spay/neuter), any buyer interested in full registration (with breeding rights) should mention this in our initial conversation. There will be an additional fee for full registration.\n\nThe kittens will receive a bill of good health from my veterinarian prior to heading to their new homes and a vet visit is required within 72 hours of when you pick-up your kitten (proof of the visit is required). We do provide a health warranty for full refund within 72 hours if your vet deems the kitten unsuitable for sale (with documentation required from your vet and potentially a second opinion from mine) and it should be stated that health issues are the only valid cause for any refund. Our health guarantee supports our belief that we are producing healthy off-spring and that we want to know if any of our kittens show signs of genetically related issues. Thus, if your kitten or cat is diagnosed with a serious genetic defect or congenital disease before 2 years of age we will provide a replacement kitten and work with you to determine the best option for the sick kitten or cat. The types of conditions that would be included as a genetic defect of congenital disease would be life-threatening heart conditions and degenerative nerve disorders (in other words, conditions that effect longevity or quality of life; allergies and innocent heart murmurs do not fall into this category).\n\nPhotos are of the kittens are of some of our past kittens.\n\nGenotype Cats\nwww.genotypecats.com\n\nwww.tranquillhedgies.com\nwww.paradigmpups.com", "main_img_url": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/JFK6gGNeW1.jpg", "detail_url": "http://www.hoobly.com/zrEHP/ragdoll-juveniles-and-kittens-available-three-ready-to-go-anytime.htm", "img_urls": ["http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/4PCLXtYLca.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/JFK6gGNeW1.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/KzhkFgjlRG.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/PyNKfdp0xC.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/ZO1u0TEcDM.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/aXsR52c2Nc.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/ha4eICgzff.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/qmVXBu1a3D.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/qyfy8nUVTp.jpg", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/pics.hoobly.com/full/w9Xi4WXSs5.jpg"]}, {"id": "TpRGd", "title": "Ragdoll Kittens", "desc": "1 girl 2 boy doing great growing fast\r\nThey have a two year genetic health guarantee \r\n\r\n\r", "location": "Fort Wayne, Indiana", "posted": "2017-10-03", "updated": "2018-02-25", "breed": "Ragdoll", "price": "$700", "content": "1 girl 2 boy doing great growing fast\r\nThey have a two year genetic health guarantee\n\nKittens are growing so fast lots of playing current on shots and wormings litter box trained.Very Social.\n\nNo breeding rights\n\nBoth parents have been HCM cleared\n\nKittens are current with shots and worming to age.\n\nTICA registered\n\nLovely colors and markings.
